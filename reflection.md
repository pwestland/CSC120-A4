- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

I think that encapsulation can be difficult because you have to keep track of all of your components and whether they're public, private, etc. while still keeping track of everything else in the code.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think my smaller classes worked better than the train one, there were more issues in the train class than the rest. I would definitely give the advice to double check all of your method and variable names to make sure they're consistent, especially with capitalization and such, because it's very easy to overlook those. Also, punctuation can be tricky, I forgot to put a semicolon at the end of a line a few times, and it messed up my code.
